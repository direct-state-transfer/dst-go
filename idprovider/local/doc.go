// Package local contains an implementation of ID provider, where
// the peer IDs are stored in a YAML file stored locally on the disk.
//
// The complete list of peer IDs are loaded into an in-memory cache during
// initialization. The entries in the cache are indexed by both alias and
// off-chain address of the peer and can be using either of these as reference.
//
// Read, Write and Delete operations act only on the cache and do
// not affect the contents of the file.
//
// Latest state of cache can be updated to the file by explicitly calling
// UpdateStorage method. Normally this should be called before shutting down
// the node.
